# samples
This repository contains sample integration code for Identity Challenge and Single Sign On+.

Samples come in two flavors:
 * **API**: Integration straight into the API, making it more flexible to customize UI/UX at the cost of a bit more development work.
 * **Widget**: Integration using Widget Library, making it really easy to integrate at the cost of a less flexible UI/UX.

Samples are currently written in [PHP](http://php.net), more to come in the future.

Check the README on each folders for more details.
