# samples
This repository contains sample integration and interface codes for Identity Challenge and Single Sign On+.

Integration Samples come in three flavors:
 * **API**: Integration straight into the API, making it more flexible to customize UI/UX at the cost of a bit more development work.
 * **Gateway**: Integration using a Veridu hosted integration, the perfect balance between UI/UX flexibility and integration effort.
 * **Widget**: Integration using Widget Library, making it really easy to integrate at the cost of a less flexible UI/UX.

Check the README on each folders for more details.
