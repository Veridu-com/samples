# samples
This repository contains sample integration and interface codes for Identity Challenge and Single Sign On+.

Integration Samples come in two flavors:
 * **API**: Integration straight into the API, making it more flexible to customize UI/UX at the cost of a bit more development work.
 * **Widget**: Integration using Widget Library, making it really easy to integrate at the cost of a less flexible UI/UX.

Interface Samples cover different usage needs, mostly around creating flexible UI/UX.

Integration samples are currently written in [PHP](http://php.net) and interface samples are currently written in JavaScript.

Check the README on each folders for more details.
